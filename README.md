# Syllabus: Industrial Organization
**Institution**: Toulouse School of Economics  
**Session**: Spring 2024  
**Teachers**: Isis Durrmeyer, Bruno Jullien and Patrick Rey

## Course objectives
This  is  a  course  in  the  Graduate  Industrial  Organization  sequence.  We  aim  to  give  a  solid 
grounding  in  understanding  the  structure  of  markets,  and  the  strategic  behavior  of  firms 
and their consumers. This course has three parts:  
1.  Vertical relations (Patrick Rey). 
2. Two-sided markets (Bruno Jullien).  
3. Empirical methods and research topics in industrial organization at the frontier of the 
empirical IO research (Isis Durrmeyer)
